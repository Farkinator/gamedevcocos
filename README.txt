HOW TO PLAY MARK SEDDON THE GAME:

* Swap blocks by clicking adjacent blocks to match 3 or more in a row of the same type.
	- A move is legal only if it results in a match
* The block with arrows rotates the board ninety degrees clockwise.
* The blocks with a small square in the middle must be moved to the center (surrounded by rainbows).
	- Matching 4 blocks of any type in a row will create a Win condition block.
	- When all 4 center squares have the smallsquare blocks, you have won
	- Swapping a square block into the middle four squares is always a legal move.

If you run out of moves or run out of time, you lose, resulting in your score
being square rooted.
