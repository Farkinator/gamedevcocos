	* Run around collecting teleprompter cards, avoid the bad things
		- top-down
		- set in the middle east
		- dodge IEDs, stray bullets
	* Running around terring down posters for other politicians
		- 
	* Political campaign simulator but more exciting
	* TCG
		- point is to trade cards that represent pieces of story, and you're trying
		to create before the other players get there (Think pit or cash)
	* Match-3 where you match up news stories
		- the types of news stories give different bonuses and powers
		- spin on a match maybe?
		- something affected by gravity as opposed to being stacked on top of each other
			* a block that always drops to the bottom
				- Matching gravity box that falls to the bottom resets your problem
				- spawn like a normal block, but fall to the bottom through other blocks



Things that need to get done:
	* blocks (5/6)
	* GUI 
	* controls: click one, click the other, they switch.
	* 2-d array 
	* animations for blocks falling (programmatic)
	* animations for rotating (programmatic)
	* Start menu, high scores, pause screen
	* 
	- the higher the score, the better story you get?

IDEAS:
	* Don't like games that are entirely time-based
		- timers seem like a last resort to make a puzzle game hard
	* Score thresholds for rotating the board?
		- special block that rotates the board?
	* row shifting
