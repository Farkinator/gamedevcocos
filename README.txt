	* Match-3 where you match up news stories
		- the types of news stories give different bonuses and powers
		- spin on a match maybe?

=====================================================9/20 UPDATE=============================================
Things needed: 
	-ALL ART ASSETS. (including a new block, that, when matched, rotates the board.)
	
	Code:
	-A block that, when matched, rotates the board
	-A block queue in the board, so specific blocks can be added under specific circumstances.
	-A rotation queue on board, so if there are multiple rotations in one frame it will behave correctly.
	-Four in a row matches should create a special block:
	-A block that, when four are put in the middle, will wipe the board and drastically increase your score. (or does someting else exciting... playtesting required)
	-user input on the blocks. There is already a function to do that, but it doesn't seem to do anything. 
	-Blocks need to remove themselves visually when they are deleted off the board. Perhaps they should do an animation as well.
	-Blocks need to always delete themselves when they are matched. 
	-A game over screen. This should display score, a story, and let you play again. Possibly add high scores.
	-Code that plays sound effects when something happens that should make a sound.
	
	Sound/Writing
	-Stories. 
	-Sounds.
